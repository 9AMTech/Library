#### Description
On this Library Project, the goal ultimately was to create a CRUD app but without the database. 
The idea is to update the web page to display "Book" objects by creating them from info pulled from
a form. We also have the ability to manipulate the data, then to remove the book if need be. This also
uses CSS-grids.
